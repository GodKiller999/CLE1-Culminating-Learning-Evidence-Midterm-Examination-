            <h2><i>Race/Color Discrimination & Work Situations</i></h2>
            <p>What is workplace discrimination? It is discrimination if someone in your company treats another person poorly because of one of these reasons.</p>
            <p> Businesses are accountable for ensuring that there is no employment discrimination or retribution. Any corporation may create a respectful work environment with the correct combination of well implemented regulations and a thorough analysis of its business procedures and culture.  
            Consider engaging your business in Project WHEN (Workplace Harassment Ends Now) if you are committed to protecting workers from the various forms of discrimination. 
            To show your dedication to fostering an environment free from harassment for your staff, we would first urge you to sign our Pledge of Commitment. </p>

            <h2><i>Direct Discrimination</i></h2>
            <p>A person experiences direct racial discrimination when they are disadvantaged or regarded less favorably due to: <br> the race they are
            the race of someone they are acquainted with or know; this practice is known as "discrimination by association."
            their "perceived" race, a term used to describe the practice of believing someone to be a particular race when they are not</p>

            <h2><i>Indirect Discrimination</i></h2>
            <p>According to the law, when a policy, rule, or working practice is the same for every member of a group, it constitutes indirect discrimination. <br> It would disadvantage those who have a protected trait in common.
            It disadvantages that person directly.
            The employer is unable to defend their actions.
            </p>
            <p> Not everyone who possesses a protected attribute is said to "share a protected characteristic." For instance, it might imply: <br>
            individuals who have a certain handicap, such as everyone with a comparable degree of visual impairment; this does not refer to all persons with disabilities.
            individuals in the same age range
            individuals who are similar in terms of race, such as all South East Asians
            An individual who does not possess a certain protected trait may be subjected to indirect discrimination. This is the situation where they are at the same disadvantage as someone who possesses the protected trait due to a working practice, policy, or rule.

            <h2><i>Harassment</i></h2>
            <p>When someone encounters undesirable behavior because of their race, it is known as racial harassment. Language that is racist is a common example.
            For the behavior to qualify as harassment, it must have either: <br>
            transgressed a person's dignity
            generated a setting that was frightening, aggressive, demeaning, disrespectful, or humiliating</p>

            <h2><i>Victimisation</i></h2>
            <p>When someone receives less favorable treatment because they are connected to a discrimination or harassment complaint, this is known as victimization.
            Whether the complaint came from them or from someone else is irrelevant. In the event that someone believes they are connected to a complaint, the law also shields them from being victimized.
            Victimization can take many forms, such as being called a troublemaker, excluded, or denied access to something.
